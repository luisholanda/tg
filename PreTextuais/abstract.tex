This work presents a new model of API generator, intending to solve problems that
current solutions have. These problems are related to low integration with other
development tools such as ORMs and validators. We also show that the use of a
generator integrating effectively with the rest of the ecosystem can result in
significant efficiency gains for a development team and open doors for the use of
other tools that would not be possible without it. One motivation for this work
is to search for increased efficiency and automation within the development process
and reduce defects in complex systems.
