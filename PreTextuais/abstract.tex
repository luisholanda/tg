Web systems have a very diversified degree of complexity, ranging from a commercial
system from a neighborhood market to the complete system of a multi-national on a
global scale. To simplify the development of these systems, several tools have been
developed.

This work presents a new model of API generator, intending to solve problems that
these currently present. They are related to low integration with other development
tools, such as Object-Relational Mappings (ORMs) and validators. We also show that
the use of a generator that efficiently integrates with the rest of the ecosystem
can result in big efficiency gains for the development and open doors for the use
of other tools that would not be possible without it. One motivation for this
work is the search for increased efficiency and automation within the development
process and reducing the incidence of defects in complex systems.
